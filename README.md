# A Gentle Introduction to Mobile Development

This book will help you get a better understanding on how to create, publish and maintain your multiplatform mobile app.

This book was started after realizing that it is currently extremely difficult to find a unique and reliable source concerning multiplatform app development. So our aim with this book is to share with everyone the knowledge we have gathered regarding the creation of mobile applications.

In the following chapters, not only will we talk about the technologies and coding but we will also also discuss the many processes and tools we use everyday in our projects to build better, faster, stronger apps.
