# Android Keystore

## Introduction on the keystores

Keystores are files containing security certificates and are primarily used to
sign Android APK files. Usually you'll manage a single keystore that is used for
your app in production. There is also a debug keystore that is generated by the
Android SDK. You check that it is existing on your computer :

```shell
ls $HOME/.android/debug.keystore
```

Keystores can be password protected: when it's the case, you'll be prompted for
the password when you want to use it to sign your app.

## Create a release keystore

```shell
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore
-alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```
You'll be asked for you for passwords for the keystore and key. You can enter
the same password for both.

## Signing your app

Once you have your keystore, you can sign your app with it. Start by compiling
your app in release mode, then locate the apk that was generated.
Sign this apk:

```shell
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1
-keystore my-release-key.keystore my_application.apk alias_name
```

Your apk is now signed. A good practice is to also launch a tool to optimize the
alignment of memory of the app:

```shell
zipalign -v 4 my_application.apk my_application-aligned.apk
```

You're done! You can send this APK to the Google Play store.

## Be cautious about your keystore

Keystore must be saved and never lost: if you lose a keystore, you won't be able
to sign your app and release new versions on the Google Play store. In the same
way, anyone that get access to the keystore (and its password) can use it to sign
its own application as it if were your app.

It's a good idea to never put the keystore in your git repository.
