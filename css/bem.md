# BEM

BEM is a method to name your css entity. It stands for Block Element Modifier.

#### Block:
A logically and functionally independent page component. Blocks being independent allows for their re-use, as well as facilitating the project development and support process.

#### Element:
A constituent part of a block that can't be used outside of it. For example, a menu item is not used outside of the context of a menu block, therefore it is an element.

#### Modifier:
A BEM entity that defines the appearance and behavior of a block or an element. For instance, the appearance of the menu block (menu) may change depending on a modifier that is used on it.
