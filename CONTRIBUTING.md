Contributing
============

This book is maintainted by [BAM](http://www.bamlab.fr) team and it is open for contributions from anyone. These are few guidelines to make any contribution efficient and streamline the workflow.

Tools
-----

* The project uses [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) to generate the final file. The published book is updated automatically using the master branch.
* We don't use the GitBook desktop client as we prefer to use our own git process, which we find cleaner and faster for somebody who knows git
* All articles are written using the Markdown language.

How to write a chapter
----------------------

* All proposed subjects are available on [our Trello board](https://trello.com/b/OgrhugI8/git-book-a-gentle-introduction-to-mobile-development)
* If you want to take a ticket from the Sprint Backlog, mark yourself as a member and put it in the Doing column
* When writing your article :
 * create a seaprate branch for you article
 * write your article in a separate file under the adapted section
 * do not forget to add your article to SUMMARY.md
* Once your article is finished, make a pull request and put the ticket in the Review column
* All project members are invited to review a pending pull request
* Once all discussions on a PR are resolved a Release Manager will merge it into the master branch
